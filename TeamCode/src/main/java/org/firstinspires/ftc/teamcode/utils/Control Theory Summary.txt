Part I: Fundamentals of Control Theory

Chapter 1: Control System Basics

Control systems are essential in robotics and many other fields, regulating the behavior of devices
like thermostats, cruise control, and autonomous vehicles. In this chapter, the book defines the
fundamental components of control systems:

Plant: The system being controlled.
Controller: The system (software or hardware) responsible for driving the plant from its current
state to a desired state.
Input: The signal applied to the system (from the controller).
Output: The systemâ€™s response to the input.
In closed-loop systems, feedback from the output is used to adjust the control input. This loop is
essential in making systems robust to disturbances and uncertainties.

The chapter also introduces block diagrams, a graphical way to represent control systems. In
these diagrams, the plant and controller are represented as blocks, and arrows indicate the flow of
inputs and outputs. The use of negative feedback is common in control systems because it minimizes
error by adjusting the input based on the current state of the system.

Chapter 2: PID Controllers

A PID controller consists of three components that work together to control a system:

Proportional (P) Term: The proportional term adjusts the input based on the magnitude of the
error.

The proportional term is analogous to a spring, pulling the system back towards the desired
state. However, it alone can lead to steady-state error, where the system stabilizes slightly
off-target due to insufficient corrective force.
Integral (I) Term: The integral term addresses steady-state errors by accumulating past
errors.
The integration gain and the integration variable. This term adds the
sum of past errors over time, driving the system closer to the setpoint, even if the proportional
term alone cannot eliminate the error.
Derivative (D) Term: The derivative term predicts future error based on the rate of change of
the error.
The derivative gain. This term acts like a damper, slowing down the system as
it approaches the target to prevent overshooting.
The complete PID control law combines these three terms
This equation forms the basis of most feedback control systems in robotics. The chapter also
discusses manual tuning of PID controllers, which involves adjusting the gains


Chapter 3: Transfer Functions

The concept of transfer functions is introduced to analyze linear time-invariant systems.
The Laplace transform is a mathematical tool that converts time-domain functions into the
frequency domain, simplifying the analysis of dynamic systems.

By analyzing poles and zeroes, engineers can predict how a system will behave in response to
inputs, including its stability and speed of response.

Part II: Modern Control Theory

Chapter 4: Linear Algebra

Linear algebra provides the foundation for modern control theory. This chapter covers essential
topics like vectors, matrices, and eigenvalues, which are necessary for representing complex
control systems.

Vectors represent states in a control system, such as position or velocity.
Matrices represent transformations between these states, such as rotations or scaling
operations. In control systems, matrices are often used to represent the relationship between
multiple inputs and outputs.
One key concept is the eigenvalue decomposition of matrices, which is used to understand the
stability and dynamics of systems:

Eigenvalues play a critical role in determining the behavior of systems, including their stability.

Chapter 5: State-Space Controllers

In contrast to classical control methods like PID, state-space control is more versatile and
powerful for controlling systems with multiple inputs and outputs (MIMO). The state-space
representation of a system is given by a set of first-order differential equations:

State-space representation provides a more flexible framework for analyzing and controlling
systems, especially when dealing with MIMO systems. Two key concepts in state-space control are
controllability and observability:

A system is controllable if, by using an appropriate input, the system can be driven from any
initial state to any desired final state.
A system is observable if, based on the output, the internal states of the system can be
inferred.
The chapter also covers techniques such as pole placement and the Linear-Quadratic
Regulator (LQR), which provide optimal ways to control systems by minimizing a cost function.

Chapter 6: Digital Control

Most modern control systems are implemented on digital computers, which requires discretizing
continuous systems. This chapter discusses methods for discretizing systems, including zero-order
hold and the bilinear transform. It also introduces the concept of the z-plane, which is the
discrete equivalent of the s-plane used in continuous control systems.

Key topics include the Nyquist frequency (the maximum frequency that can be accurately
represented in a digital system) and the effects of discretization on system performance.

Part III: Estimation and Localization

Chapter 9: Stochastic Control Theory

In real-world systems, measurements are often noisy, and systems are subject to uncertainty.
Stochastic control theory deals with systems in which randomness plays a role. One of the
primary tools for dealing with this uncertainty is the Kalman filter, which estimates the internal
states of a system based on noisy measurements. The Kalman filter works by predicting the state
and then updating that prediction based on new measurements.

The Kalman filter equations consist of two steps
Part IV: System Modeling

Chapter 12: Dynamics

The chapter on dynamics covers both linear and angular motion. Robotics often involves
systems with curvilinear motion, such as differential drives (used in tank-style robots) and
swerve drives (which allow more agile movements). The chapter includes the equations of motion
for these systems and explains how they are modeled for control purposes.

Part V: Motion Planning

Chapter 15: Motion Profiles

Motion profiles define how a robot transitions from one state to another. This chapter explains how
to generate smooth, feasible paths for robots, given their physical constraints. The concept of
jerk (the rate of change of acceleration) is introduced to create smooth profiles.

Chapter 16: Trajectory Optimization

Optimization techniques are discussed for planning complex motions in robotics, ensuring that
robots move in an efficient and physically achievable manner.
